        [01:18.61] 不是一般人的认真

    [00:52.01] But as rude and indecent as all hell
    [00:53.42] Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
    [00:55.16] This flippity, dippity-hippity hip-hop
    [00:56.54] You don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappity-rap
    [00:59.08] Packing a mack in the back of the Ac, backpack rap, crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
    [01:02.04] And at the exact same time
    [01:03.76] I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that
    [01:05.08] I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
    [01:06.86] Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
    [01:08.55] Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
    [01:12.10] How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack
    [01:15.31] Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a Maxi-Pad
    [01:16.86] It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
    [01:19.16] while I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece yeah
    [01:22.00] Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
    [01:24.84] All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
    [01:28.01] Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
    [01:31.25] Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard
    [01:34.50] Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got
    [01:37.82] Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance
    [01:40.63] Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
    [01:43.78] Hit the earth like an asteroid, and did nothing but shoot for the moon since (PPEEYOOM)
    [01:45.62] MC's get taken to school with this music
    [01:47.38] Cause I use it as a vehicle to 'bus the rhyme'
    [01:48.44] Now I lead a new school full of students
    [01:55.88] Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac N-W-A., Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
    [01:56.84] Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and being in a position
    [01:59.72] To meet Run-D.M.C. and induct them into the motherfuckin' Rock n'
    [02:03.26] Roll Hall of Fame even though I walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
    [02:07.02] Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
    [02:09.34] On the wall of shame
    [02:10.55] You fags think it's all a game 'til I walk a flock of flames
    [02:13.61] Off of planking, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
    [02:16.62] Little gay looking boy
    [02:17.81] So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy
    [02:19.85] You witnessing a massacre
    [02:21.08] Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy
    [02:23.21] Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say looking boy
    [02:26.43] You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
    [02:27.88] And a way to go from your label everyday looking boy
    [02:29.58] Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?
    [02:31.22] I got a "hell yeah" from Dre looking boy
    [02:32.80] I'mma work for everything I have
    [02:34.26] Never ask nobody for shit, get outta my face looking boy
    [02:36.05] Basically boy you're never gonna be capable
    [02:38.08] To keep up with the same pace looking boy
    [02:39.39] Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
    [02:42.66] All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
    [02:45.82] The way I'm racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar
    [02:49.02] Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
    [02:51.78] Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard
    [02:55.50] So you be Thor and I'll be Odin
    [02:57.14] You rodent, I'm omnipotent
    [02:59.28] Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
    [03:02.18] And I should not be woken
    [03:04.14] I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
    [03:07.31] But I got your mom deep throating
    [03:08.87] I'm out my ramen noodle
    [03:12.55] We have nothing in common, poodle
    [03:13.55] I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
    [03:15.30] It's me, my honesty's brutal
    [03:18.02] But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
    [03:20.88] For good at least once in a while
    [03:23.18] So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
    [03:26.02] Enough rhymes to maybe to try and help get some people through tough times
    [03:29.52] But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned
    [03:31.18] Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
    [03:33.55] I know there was a time where once I
    [03:35.31] Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
    [03:38.53] So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
    [03:40.28] Appeal with the skin color of mine
    [03:42.45] You get too big and here they come trying to censor you
    [03:44.25] Like that one line I said on "I'm Back" from the Marshall Mathers LP
    [03:47.56] One where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine
    [03:50.39] Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine
    [03:54.17] See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I've Morphed into an immortal coming through the portal
    [04:00.26] You're stuck in a timewarp from 2004 though
    [04:02.59] And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
    [04:04.49] You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows
    [04:07.03] You're like normal, fuck being normal
    [04:08.82] And I just bought a new Raygun from the future
    [04:10.87] To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
    [04:13.40] Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether’s pad
    [04:16.25] Singin' to a man while they played piano
    [04:18.38] Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
    [04:20.04] So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
    [04:22.85] ''Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you''
    [04:24.07] Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)
    [04:26.22] Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human
    [04:28.33] What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman
    [04:29.60] Innovative and I'm made of rubber
    [04:31.04] So that anything you saying ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you
    [04:32.80] I'm never stating, more than never demonstrating
    [04:34.41] How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
    [04:36.04] Never fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting
    [04:37.94] For the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating
    [04:39.50] Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
    [04:40.77] I make elevating music, you make elevator music
    [04:43.00] Oh, he's too mainstream
    [04:44.08] Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
    [04:46.69] It's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it
    [04:49.01] With rock, shock rap with Doc
    [04:51.02] Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
    [04:52.90] I don't know how to make songs like that
    [04:54.22] I don't know what words to use
    [04:55.71] Let me know when it occurs to you
    [04:57.09] While I’m ripping any one of these verses diverse as you
    [04:58.71] It’s curtains, I’m inadvertently hurtin' you
    [05:00.39] How many verses I gotta murder to prove
    [05:01.88] That if you're half as nice at songs you can sacrifice virgins too
    [05:05.53] School flunkie, pill junky
    [05:07.69] But look at the accolades the skills brung me
    [05:10.24] Full of myself, but still hungry
    [05:12.11] I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to
    [05:14.63] And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues
    [05:18.57] But it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you
    [05:20.36] I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat
    [05:24.01] Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funky
    [05:26.21] But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
    [05:30.24] Angels fight with devils, here's what they want from me
    [05:33.76] They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
    [05:35.52] But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had
    [05:37.34] Then you may be a little patient and more symphatetic to the situation
    [05:40.50] And understand the discrimation
    [05:42.50] But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
    [05:48.37] But if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
    [05:49.34] Don't mistake it for Satan
    [05:50.28] It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
    [05:52.92] And take a vacation to trip a broad
    [05:54.25] And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard
    [05:56.97] Be a king? Think not—why be a king when you can be a God?`,
